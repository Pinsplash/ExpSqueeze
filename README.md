# ExpSqueeze
ExpSqueeze finds the average amount of experience in Pokemon that can be gained from a single wild encounter within an encounter table, along with many other stats. ExpSqueeze works for most mainline Pokemon games except Generation 8+. The data generated by ExpSqueeze can be filtered and manipulated in many different ways to make it easier to find the perfect place to train a pokemon or for other analytical uses.

* Accounting for factors that change encounter tables, like the time of day.
* Ability to filter by the types of pokemon.
* Rematchable trainers.
* Adjusting calculated experience when repels are used.
* Filtering and sorting by EV yields.
* Filter tables by what part of the game you're in.
* And a lot more!

## How it works
Encounter tables consist of encounter slots. Every slot has a Pokemon, minimum and maximum level, and % chance value. ExpSqueeze finds the average level given the minimum and maximum level, solves the leftmost fraction of the [experience gain formula](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Experience#Gain_formula), and then weighs this according to the slot's % chance. This is done for every slot. When the numbers are added up, you get the encounter table's average experience per encounter.
